        <p><br><strong>Mickey Mouse</strong> is a funny animal cartoon character and the mascot of 
            <b>The Walt Disney Company</b>. He was created by <b>Walt Disney</b> and <b>Ub Iwerks
            </b> at the <b>Walt Disney Studios</b> in <b>1928</b>.An anthropomorphic mouse who 
            typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey is one of 
            the world's most recognizable characters.<br>Created as a replacement for a prior 
            Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Mickey first appeared in the short Plane
            Crazy, debuting publicly in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first 
            sound cartoons. He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert 
            (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in
            short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons 
            were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend
            a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to 
            have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<br>Beginning in 1930, Mickey has also
            been featured extensively as a comic strip character. His self-titled newspaper 
            strip, drawn primarily by Floyd Gottfredson, ran for 45 years. Mickey has also appeared
            in comic books such as Disney Italy's Topolino, MM - Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, 
            and Wizards of Mickey, and in television series such as The Mickey Mouse Club 
            (1955-1996) and others. He also appears in other media such as video games as 
            well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks.<br>
            Mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto,
            his friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete. Though originally characterized
            as a cheeky lovable rogue, Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy, usually seen
            as an honest and bodacious hero. In 2009, Disney began to rebrand the character again by 
            putting less emphasis on his friendly, well-meaning persona and reintroducing the more
            menacing and stubborn sides of his personality, beginning with the video game Epic Mickey.

        <h3><u>MICKEY MOUSE : The Design</u></h3>
            <img src="img/design.png" 
                 alt="Mickey Mouse" id="image" width="300" height="250">
            <p>Throughout the earlier years, Mickey's design bore heavy resemblance to Oswald, 
                save for the ears, nose, and tail.Ub Iwerks designed Mickey's body out 
                of circles in order to make the character simple to animate. Disney employees John 
                Hench and Marc Davis believed that this design was part of Mickey's success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences.
                Mickey's circular design is most noticeable in his ears. In animation in the 1940s, 
                Mickey's ears were animated in a more realistic perspective. Later, they were drawn 
                to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was facing. This made Mickey 
                easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. 
                The circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a 
                three-dimensional Mickey.
            <br>In 1938, animator Fred Moore redesigned Mickey's body away from its circular design 
            to a pear-shaped design. Colleague Ward Kimball praised Moore for being the first 
            animator to break from Mickey's "rubber hose, round circle" design. Although Moore 
            himself was nervous at first about changing Mickey, Walt Disney liked the new design 
            and told Moore <br><b>"That's the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on."</b></p>
